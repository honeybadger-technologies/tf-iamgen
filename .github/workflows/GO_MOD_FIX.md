# Go Module Dependency Fix

**Issue:** `go: github.com/inconshreveable/log15@...: invalid version`  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**  
**Date:** October 27, 2025

---

## 🔧 What Was Wrong

The `go.mod` file had explicit indirect dependencies with invalid version references:

```go
// ❌ BEFORE (broken)
require (
  github.com/inconshreveable/log15 v2.3.1-0.20200130042432-9385bec1d4b6+incompatible
  // ... other problematic indirect deps
)
```

This caused Go to fail when trying to resolve dependencies because the pseudo-version reference doesn't exist in the repository.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Simplified go.mod** 
Removed all explicit indirect dependencies:

```go
// ✅ AFTER (fixed)
module github.com/honeybadger/tf-iamgen

go 1.21

require (
  github.com/spf13/cobra v1.7.0
  github.com/hashicorp/hcl/v2 v2.18.1
  github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2 v1.24.0
  github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/cloudtrail v1.33.0
  gopkg.in/yaml.v3 v3.0.1
)
```

### 2. **Updated Workflows**
Added `go mod tidy` step before dependency resolution:

```yaml
- name: Clean up go.mod
  run: go mod tidy
```

### 3. **Updated Makefile**
Updated `install-deps` target:

```makefile
install-deps: ## Install Go dependencies
  $(GO) mod tidy       # Clean first
  $(GO) mod download   # Then download
  $(GO) mod verify     # Then verify
```

---

## 🚀 How to Deploy

```bash
# Stage the changes
git add go.mod
git add .github/workflows/test.yml
git add Makefile

# Commit
git commit -m "fix: resolve go module dependency issues

- Remove explicit indirect dependencies from go.mod
- Let Go automatically resolve transitive dependencies
- Add go mod tidy to workflows for consistency
- Update Makefile to tidy before downloading"

# Push
git push origin main
```

## 🔍 How It Works Now

### When You Push to GitHub

1. **Checkout code** → Gets latest code
2. **Set up Go** → Installs Go with cache
3. **Clean up go.mod** → Runs `go mod tidy`
   - Removes unused indirect deps
   - Fixes broken references
   - Resolves version mismatches
4. **Download dependencies** → Fetches all modules
5. **Verify dependencies** → Checks module integrity
6. **Run tests** → Proceeds with testing

### When You Develop Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies with cleanup
make install-deps

# Or manually
go mod tidy
go mod download
go mod verify
```

---

## ✨ Why This Works

**The Problem:**
- Indirect dependencies are transitive (pulled by direct deps)
- Explicit pseudo-versions can become invalid
- Go can't always resolve broken references

**The Solution:**
- Let Go manage indirect dependencies automatically
- Use `go mod tidy` to keep go.mod clean
- Only specify direct dependencies explicitly
- Go will resolve all transitive deps correctly

## 📋 What Gets Downloaded Now

When you run `go mod download`, these are downloaded:

```
Direct dependencies (explicitly required):
  ✅ github.com/spf13/cobra v1.7.0
  ✅ github.com/hashicorp/hcl/v2 v2.18.1
  ✅ github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2 v1.24.0
  ✅ github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/cloudtrail v1.33.0
  ✅ gopkg.in/yaml.v3 v3.0.1

Transitive dependencies (automatically resolved):
  ✅ github.com/spf13/pflag (required by cobra)
  ✅ github.com/zclconf/go-cty (required by hcl/v2)
  ✅ github.com/hashicorp/hcl2 (required by hcl/v2)
  ✅ ... and all other transitive deps
```

All resolved automatically by Go!

## 🔄 Workflow Now

```
Developer Local Development
  ↓
make install-deps (tidy + download + verify)
  ↓
make test (runs tests)
  ↓
git push
  ↓
GitHub Actions
  ↓
go mod tidy (clean before download)
  ↓
go mod download (get all deps)
  ↓
go mod verify (check integrity)
  ↓
Tests run ✅
```

---

## ✅ Verification

After pushing, verify:

1. **Workflows run without errors**
   ```bash
   GitHub → Actions → All 3 workflows pass ✅
   ```

2. **Dependencies are resolved**
   ```bash
   GitHub Actions → Logs → No "invalid version" errors
   ```

3. **Tests pass**
   ```bash
   GitHub Actions → Tests workflow → ✅ All tests pass
   ```

4. **go.mod is clean**
   ```bash
   GitHub → Code → go.mod (only direct deps)
   ```

---

## 💡 Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Always run `go mod tidy` locally before pushing**
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   git diff go.mod  # Review changes
   git add go.mod
   ```

2. **Update dependencies regularly**
   ```bash
   go get -u ./...  # Update all direct deps
   go mod tidy      # Clean up
   ```

3. **Never pin indirect dependencies manually**
   - Let Go manage them automatically
   - Only pin direct dependencies if needed

4. **Check for broken versions before pushing**
   ```bash
   make install-deps
   make test
   ```

## ⚠️ If Problems Still Occur

### Scenario 1: Dependency still failing

```bash
# Force clean and rebuild
rm -rf vendor/
rm go.sum
go mod tidy
go mod download
go mod verify
```

### Scenario 2: Specific module incompatible

```bash
# Check if module is actually needed
go mod graph | grep problematic-module

# If not needed, it will disappear after go mod tidy
```

### Scenario 3: Network issues in GitHub Actions

This is usually transient. The workflows will retry automatically.
If persistent, check GitHub Actions status page.
